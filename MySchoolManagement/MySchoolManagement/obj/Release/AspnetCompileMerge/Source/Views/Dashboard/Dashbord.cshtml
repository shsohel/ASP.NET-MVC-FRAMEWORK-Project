    <h2>Welcome to School Management System</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
     The aim of School Management Software is to manage students, teachers and administrative data. This system basically looks after the day to day administration, attendance management, time-table, enrolment and many other services. The positive aspect about this system is that it can be used by any school, college or university regardless of whichever board they follow. This system is very beneficial because it brings together the administration, students, parents and teachers under one single platform. It helps in reducing the paper work of schools and colleges which they have to manage every day. It benefits teacher, students and parents as they can keep track on the on-going activities of the school.
